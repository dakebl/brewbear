# Writing about living simply

Welcome to BrewBear, our new blog on simple living. 

This new space is a place for us to write about our experiences as we learn and experiment with living a more self-sufficient lifestyle.

Our goals are to learn new skills, reduce our consumption and waste, simplify our lifestyle, be more environmentally conscious, and stay connected to our food and our community. 

The things we are likely to cover are: 
- Fermenting food and drink
- Cooking and baking
- Growing herbs, vegetables and flowers
- Hand carving and woodwork
- Bushcraft and nature writing 
- Anything creative we feel like sharing

We're currently in the process of fermenting our first batch of kombucha, so we'll post about our experience in the next fews days and let you know how we did.
