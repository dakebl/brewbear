  <p>Welcome to BrewBear, our new blog on simple living.</p>
<p>This new space is a place for us to write about our experiences as we learn and experiment with living a more self-sufficient lifestyle.</p>
<p>Our goal is to learn new skills, reduce our consumption and waste, simplify our lifestyle, be more environmentally conscious, and stay connected to nature.</p>
<p>The things we are likely to cover are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fermenting food and drink</li>
<li>Cooking and baking</li>
<li>Growing herbs, vegetables and flowers</li>
<li>Hand carving and woodwork</li>
<li>Bushcraft and nature writing</li>
<li>Anything creative we feel like sharing</li>
</ul>
<p>We're currently in the process of fermenting our first batch of kombucha, so we'll post about our experience in the next fews days.</p>
